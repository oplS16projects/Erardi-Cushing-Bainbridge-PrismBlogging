# PRISM BLOGGING
Our project is focused on creating a platform for us to write blogs to update users on changes for our GUI II project website, Prism.

##Overview
Prism is a website for photographers to keep a minimal portfolio of their photographs for their friends and other followers to see. For this project we created a GUI interface in which we can write blogs to update users on recent developments in this website, Prism. When a blog is finished, it is submitted and saved into the postgreSQL database. This database is accessed and displayed online using web applications in racket.

##Concepts Demonstrated
Identify the OPL concepts demonstrated in your project. Be brief. A simple list and example is sufficient. 
Our DOM data was constructed via recursive data structures by recursively callingnour PostgreSQL databsse
* **Data abstraction** is used to provide access to the elements of the RSS feed.
* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**
* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.

##External Technology and Libraries
Briefly describe the existing technology you utilized, and how you used it. Provide a link to that technology(ies).

[The Graphical Interface Toolkit](http://docs.racket-lang.org/gui/index.html)
Alex used this library to create a GUI interface for creating a blog post (title, body) as well as a success confirmation. 

[Web Applications in Racket](http://docs.racket-lang.org/web-server/)
James used this library to create a web page for displaying the blog posts in a browser. 

[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=css) 
Alex wrote CSS for styling the web page to make it aesthetically pleasing.

[Database](http://docs.racket-lang.org/db/):
Tyler wrote queries for inserting information into a database as well as retrieving blog posts to wrap in HTML to display and style the posts in Jamesâ€™ web application.

##Favorite Scheme Expressions
####Mark (a team member)
Each team member should identify a favorite expression or procedure, written by them, and explain what it does. Why is it your favorite? What OPL philosophy does it embody?
Remember code looks something like this:
```scheme
(map (lambda (x) (foldr compose functions)) data)
```
####Tyler
I wrote a function that utilizes a map which uses a lambda expression as well as other functions to write HTML Markup to display the blogs on the page. 
```scheme
(define (displayMarkup)
  (set! markup "")
  (makeopenRoot)
  (map (lambda (row) (makeOpenPost) (makeTitle (getTitle row)) (makeBody (getBody row)) (makeClosePost) ) (allPosts))
  (makecloseRoot)
  (string->xexpr markup))
```

###Alex
I wrote the GUI and this is an example of how you can manipulate the properties.
```racket
(define output
      (new text-field%
           [label "blog"]
           [style '(multiple)]
           [min-height 20]
           [vert-margin 20]
           [min-width 400]
           [parent panel]))
  ```

##Additional Remarks
Anything else you want to say in your report. Can rename or remove this section.

#How to Download and Run
You may want to link to your latest release for easy downloading by people (such as Mark).
